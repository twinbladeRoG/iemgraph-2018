                The 1st International conference IEMGraph’18 – International Conference on Emerging
                Technology in Modelling and Graphics, will be held 6-7
                
                th September 2018 in Kolkata, India. The
                conference will include keynote talks, regular papers and poster communications. IEMGraph’18
                seeks outstanding papers describing contributions to the theoretical and practical aspects of image
                processing and graphical modeling of objects presented in images along with applications in this
                field.

                The proceedings of IEMGraph’18 will be included in the Springer’s Advances in Intelligent
                Systems and Computing series (AISC).    
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                IEMGraph’18 also offers pre-conference workshops where the researchers can exchange their
                knowledge with other countries of common interests. We may also organize a Skype session for
                the presenter who is unable to attend our conference for a proper reason with prior permission. The
                conference offers a poster presentation session to demonstrate a good quality research work in this
                arena throughout the conference. Also, registration fees can be paid through credit card or bank
                transfer. Accommodation may be given but in that case, accommodation fees should be included
                in registration fees.
