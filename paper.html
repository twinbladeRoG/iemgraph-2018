              <h5>Submission Guidelines</h5>

              <hr />
    
              <p>
                  Submitted papers must be original, and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. Submitted paper length should be within 12 pages (max) in the Springer AISC one-column format. Papers must use the latest Springer's Word template or LaTeX macro package and must be submitted as PDF through the EasyChair conference system. (Do NOT use a fake name for your EasyChair login; your EasyChair account information is hidden from reviewers.) All authors have to follow Springer's guidelines or writing the paper.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                  Double-blind reviewing will be provided, so submitted papers must use blank or fake author names and affiliations. For the peer review purpose, self-references are NOT permitted. If the author needs to refer his/her own paper the reference MUST be made in third person in text description of the submitted article. Any attempt to reveal author details and affiliation at the time of initial submission will lead to rejection summarily of the paper without further processing.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                  The IEMGraph-2018 Program Committee regards plagiarism as a serious professional misconduct. All submissions will be screened for plagiarism by iThenticate®, and when identified, the submissions by the same author will be rejected at any stage of the conference even after the conference and after the publication of the proceedings online from the springer. The question of reimbursement of registration fees will not be applicable here.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                  IEMGraph-2018 will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during IEMGraph's review period. These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. Authors will be required to confirm that their submissions standard to these requirements at the time of submission.

                <hr />
      
                <p>
                    There are two kinds of submissions: full paper– a paper of high quality, which will be published in the proceedings (up to 12 pages) and will be presented by the author in a corresponding track (20 minute oral presentation) and short paper – a paper that shows some novelty and general interest, but is more preliminary or in the early stages of development, which also get published in the proceedings (up to 8 pages). Rejected full papers may still be accepted as short papers, if reviewers found interest in the idea, but the paper quality was not sufficient to be published in full length.     
                </p>
                <br />
                
                <p>
                    For each accepted paper (full or short), there must be an accompanying AUTHOR REGISTRATION. Author names may be changed or re-ordered after reviewing; however, for budgetary reasons, registration fees will be based on the details at the time of submission and review.
